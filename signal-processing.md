Signal Processing Fundamentals
------------------------------
We can’t hope to cover all the important details of one- and two-dimensional signal processing in one chapter. For those who have already seen this material, we hope this chapter will serve as a refresher. For those readers who haven’t had prior exposure to signal and image processing, we hope that this chapter will provide enough of an introduction so that the rest of the book will make sense.

All readers are referred to a number of excellent textbooks that cover one- and two-dimensional signal processing in more detail. For information on 1-D processing the reader is referred to [McG74], [Sch75], [Opp75], [Rab75]. The theory and practice of image processing have been described in [Ros82], [Gon77], [Pra78]. The more general case of multidimensional signal processing has been described in [Dud84].
